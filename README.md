# 🚀 ProjectTwin: ESP32 TX/RX IoT System with OLED and ThingSpeak Integration

A complete dual-node ESP32-based 🌐 Internet of Things system for cloud-connected data exchange. The project implements one ESP32 as a **transmitter** (TX) that periodically sends 5 string-based values to a ThingSpeak channel, and another ESP32 as a **receiver** (RX) that fetches this data, validates network and peripheral status, and displays results on both the Serial Monitor and a 128x64 OLED screen. <br>

> 🔧 This project was developed as part of a practical exercise during the **AICTE SAKEC IDEALAB Summer Internship Program 2025**, reflecting core concepts of embedded systems and IoT communication.

## 📌 Note

> ⚠️ This implementation uses only the official `ThingSpeak` library and `WiFi.h`. No `ArduinoJson` or external data parsing is used.
> >
> 🖥️ Ensure the receiver OLED is properly connected via I2C (typically SDA to GPIO 21, SCL to GPIO 22 on ESP32).
>
> 🕒 A 15-second delay is maintained as per ThingSpeak rate limits.
>
> 💡 Internal blue LED on each ESP32 acts as a WiFi connection indicator.
>
> 🔔 On the RX node, a buzzer on GPIO 4 gives a 1s beep each time new data is received.

## 🧠 System Overview

### ✉️ Transmitter (TX Node)

* Sends 5 randomly generated string values
  (e.g., `https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=...`)
* Uses `ThingSpeak.writeField()` to push data 📤
* Implements digit formatting, floating point control, and padding
* Enforces a 15-second delay between transmissions ⏳
* Illuminates onboard blue LED 🔵 when connected to WiFi

---

### 📰 Receiver (RX Node)

* Connects to WiFi, prints IP and connection status 📶
* Retrieves 5 values using `ThingSpeak.readStringField()`
* Checks OLED initialization and displays fallback errors ❌
* Shows current time, data values, and status on Serial & OLED
* Activates buzzer 🔔 on pin 4 for 1 second upon each successful retrieval
